//cluster manager - manage all node servers instaces

//first instance of node becomes cluster manager

//cluster manager creates worker instance (it is requires cluster std lib) by cluster.fork() method

//second and nexts index.js runs, create Worker Instance

//faster response (when one instance is busy, second can handle other requests), more predictable times thanks to clustering

//benchmark on mac: ab -c 1 -n 2 localhost:3000/


//machine has uppper limit to process number of threads
//cpu is trying to bounce around additional tasks, and it takes significantly longer

//need to choose appropriate number of threads to get the best performance
//appropriate number is connected with number of psychical or software cores in machine

//clustering is diffrent thing than extensions of threads in threadpool
