//node has V8 engine and libuv under the hood
//V8 is Google engine invented to write JS without browser
//libuv is necessary to user system resources like network or files
//libuv is completly written in C++
//V8 is in 70% written in C++
//Node is container whitch allows us to write code in JS

//example of pbkdf2 function (internal crypto module)
//after bunch of if-checks code binds PBKDF2 function from C++ site
//C++ uses V8 engine, gives Node easy access to underlying operation system and export functions to JS site

//OS Scheduler decides which thread should be processed
//more cores -> mutlthreading
//detected thread pause -> switch between threads

//node event loop is single threaded
//some of node framework/ std lib can be not single threaded!!!
